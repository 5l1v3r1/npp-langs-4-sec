# Introduction
This project aims to bring syntax highlighting to Notepad++ for languages, such as Yara, that are used by cybersecurity practitioners.

# Yara Language
[yara-byDissectMalware.xml](https://github.com/DissectMalware/npp-langs-4-sec/blob/master/yara-byDissectMalware.xml) is a Notepad++ UDL file, defining syntax highlighting for Yara rules.

Files with .yar or .yara extension will be automatically highlighted based on this UDL file.

If a Yara file does not ends with this extension, you can go to **Language** menu and select Yara from the submenu.
